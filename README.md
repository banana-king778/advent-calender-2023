# My Advent Code Solutions 

I started late, and I have no intention of scrambling to place on any leaderboard. The objective was to write readable solutions that made the most sense to me based on my knowledge. Like on the first day I shyed away from using regex like all the other solutions had because I do not understand it very well. 

The solutions are not fast, nor are they low code, nor are they pretty. The objective was the solution. Brute force was avoided, and solutoin are cleaned
