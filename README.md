# My Advent Code Solutions 

I started late, and I have no intention of scrambling to place on any leaderboard. The objective was to write readable solutions that made the most sense to me based on my knowledge. On the first day, I shied away from using regex because I do not understand it very well. 

The solutions are not fast, nor are they low code, nor are they pretty. The objective was the solution. Brute force was avoided, and solutions were cleaned.
